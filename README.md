# EquidistantAnalysis
This macro allows to normalize nuclei with different sizes for a precise comparison of how signal of interest is distributed throughout the nucleus. For each nucleus, the equatorial Z stack of the raw DAPI image is used to extract the nucleus contour. The selected contour is then downscaled by 20% for four times to create five equidistant nuclear regions  and to measure the mean protein-of-intensity (H3K27me3 , for ex)(in arbitrary units [a.u]) from nucleus center to the nuclear periphery in an automatized way
